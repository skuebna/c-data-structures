# AVL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
    Populate a tree via a text file (input.txt)
    After every insert, the tree must be balanced.
    At the end, display the tree in level format.
    Make sure to include the height and the balance factor of every node in your output.
    Redirect the display to  an output file (output.txt)

# AVL GENERAL INFORMATION
    The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node.
    The height of the root is the height of the tree.
    The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path).
